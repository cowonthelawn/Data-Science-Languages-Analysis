The surveys for the year 2021, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are located at:
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

They are in a google drive link in a zip file that I cannot open directly from code and are too large to upload to github

This repository comes with a processed data set to use, so it is not needed to download the survey data unless you want see the raw source

Place the unzipped folders into the data folder in the repo
